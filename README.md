# Mathler

A NextJS implementation of Mathler

## Stack and Set Up

**Stack**

- NextJS
- React
- CSS Modules
- Jest for testing

I'm using a NextJS/React stack for ease of deployment onto Vercel. Since the application will be lightweight, I'm using CSS modules instead of inline CSS for better performance and to decouple CSS from TSX.

For a quick set up, I ran:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --example with-jest with-jest-app
```

For a dev server, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```
