# Mathler Design

## Research

I used NYT's Wordle and the official Mathler as references for color choices and layout. I decided on a dark theme since that's my personal preference, and I wanted to go for a sleeker style compared to the referenced Mathler.

## Color System

I pulled the colors from Wordle's page since I'm following a dark theme, but I decided to stick with high contrast values for the sake of better accessibility.

## Typography

Since I'm planning to use MaterialUI for components, I decided to stick with Roboto which is the font that MUI is built around. The numerals and operators for Roboto also look good. For the header, I wanted a sleeker serif so I'm currently using Source Serif Pro. Both fonts are free.
